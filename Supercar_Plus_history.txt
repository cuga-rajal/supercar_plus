Supercar Plus - History

The Supercar Plus project is the continued development of a land vehicle script
originally written by Shin Ingen for a race track application in Opensim in
2014. He decided not to continue development and published the assets as open
source, which is when this project picked it up. Much of the underlying code
has changed since then but the overall framework is based on the original work.
The project also redistributes by permission some of the original assets for the
iTec race car effects.

For the last few years I have been the custodian of a large collection (~70)
scripted land vehicles at Burn2 in Second Life, the official Burning Man
regional event in Second Life. I
provide scripting kits and workshops for people building new cars. During Burn2
art festival events, server lag is always a concern, where sometimes
manay vehicles being used concurrently in a sim full of other scripted art
and avatars.

When I first became involved, vehicles in the collection had scripts
of varying sources and quality, some laggy, some poorly written. Many
didn't have desired features. We wanted one vehicle script that could merge the
best features of all of the scripts, fix the bugs, and be low lag as possible
for the server. We also wanted a way to install updates into the entire collection
with minimal hassle, ideally without having to hand-transfer settings between
scripts.

Around the time, I became involved in Opensim and there was a need to
replicate many of the vehicles there.  Our car scripts from SL didn't work in
Opensim, so we needed a script that worked in both grids.

I discovered the excellent iTec Supercar car script by Shin Ingen. This had the
most complete and creative set of features, and it was adaptable for the art
cars. I created a pared-down version that worked for both grids.
I got permission from Shin Ingen
to fork the project since he was not planning to develop it further, and created a
Github page to manage the project, and the Supercar Plus project was born. 
Burn2's DMV in SL officially switched to the Supercar Plus script in 2015.

The forst goal was to convert all the cars to the common script and place settings
in a text block at the top of the script. 
This allowed us to update vehicles with the new script (with bug fixes
for example) and only need to transfer the config settings to the new script.
Although this did require hand-editing, a single block of text in the
configuration sections could be copied and pasted between the old and new
scripts, requiring only the copy-paste keys. So the task of re-scripting 70
vehicles was not as bad as it might have been, but still not ideal.

In 2017 I added a feature to put all configuration settings in a notecard. The
script checks to see if the Config notecard is present, and if so
it will use configs in the notecard at reset time and ignore settings within the script
itself. This way, updates can be done by deleting the old script,
and dropping in the new script, without having to hand-edit any settings.

Many features and bug fixes have been added since then based on what was
needed or requested by builders. I continually try to find ways to
simplify the script, to keep it compatible
across grids, and to add new features wanted by car builders. This is a work in
progress. Please notify me of bugs or feature requests.
