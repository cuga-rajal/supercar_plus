Supercar Plus - History

In addition to hosting my own Opensim region with a collection of
driveable cars, I am the custodian of a collection of 70 scripted art
cars of all shapes and sizes, built by past and prersent members of
Burn2, the official Burning Man regional event in Second Life, As the
DMV custodian, I manage scripting in the existing collection and provide
scripting kits for people building new cars. During Burn2 art festival
events, server lag is always a challenge with lots of visitors, other
art throughout, and art cars being driven around.

Originally, vehicles in the collection had scripting with varying
sources and quality, some laggy, some poorly written, many didn't have
desired features. We wanted one vehicle script that could merge the best
features of all of the scripts, fix the bugs, and be low lag as possible
for the server. We also wanted to use a single script across all the
cars to minimize hassle of re-scripting 70+ cars in the collection when
new versions of the car script (such as bug fixes) come out.

Around the same time, in 2014, Burn2 was planning a stand-alone Opensim
demo of Burn2's art, avatars and art cars. The project required
importing vehicles into Opensim. Our car scripts from SL didn't work in
Opensim so we had to rescript. I discovered the excellent iTec Supercar
car script by Shin Ingen. We used a very pared-down version for the
Burning Man Demo. Afterwards I got permission from Shin Ingen to fork
the project since he was not planning to develop it further. I created a
Github page to manage the project and the Supercar Plus project was
born.

Long story short, I created a lightweight and powerful land vehicle
script that works well on cars with a variety of sizes and speeds, in SL
and in Opensim, and has many creative options. The script is continually
being improved and getting new features. I have been maintaining the
project since 2014, Burn2 DMV in SL officially switched to it in 2015,
but it is also used elsewhere.

In 2017 I added a feature to put all configuration settings in a
notecard. The script checks to see if the Config notecard is present,
and if so it will use configs in the notecard  and ignore settings
within the script file itself. This way, script updates can simply be
dropped into the car, replacing the previous version, without having to
hand-edit any settings.

This is a work in progress. Please notify me of bugs or feature
requests.
