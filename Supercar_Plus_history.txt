Supercar Plus - History

The Supercar Plus project is the continued development of a land vehicle script originally
by Shin Ingen for a race track application in Opensim in 2014. He decided not to
continue development and published the assets as open source, which is when this project
picked it up. Much of the underlying code has changed since then but the overall framework
is based on the original work. This project also redistributes by permission some of the
original assets for the iTec race car effects.

For the last few years I have been the custodian of a large collection (~70) of scripted
land vehicles at Burn2, the official Burning Man regional event in Second
Life. I provide scripting kits and workshops for people building new art cars. During Burn2
events, server lag is always a concern, when many vehicles are often used
concurrently in a sim full of other scripted art and avatars. 

When the project began, vehicles in the collection had scripts of varying sources and quality, some
laggy, some poorly written, some lacking desired features. We wanted one vehicle
script that could merge the best features of all of the scripts, fix the bugs, and be low
lag as possible for the server. We also wanted a way to install updates into the entire
collection with minimal hassle, ideally without needing to hand-edit settings between
scripts.

The new fork of the Supercar script was developed to satisfy these requirements. Since the
script was originally developed for compatibility across Opensim and SL, I was able to
maintain this compatibility through its development.

Over the years, features were periodically vetted for usefulness and effects on server lag.

In 2017, an option was added to put all configuration settings in a notecard. The script
checks to see if the Config notecard is present, and if so it will use configs in the
notecard at script reset time and ignore settings within the script itself. This way, script updates can
be made by replacing the old script, without having to
hand-edit any settings.

Many features and bug fixes have been added since then. Some were
requested by builders, others to solve practical problems of managing vehicles for others to use.
Feature usefulness and effects on server lag continue to be
monitored. This is a work in progress.
Please notify me of bugs or feature requests.
