Supercar Plus - History

The Supercar Plus project is the continued development of a land vehicle script
originally written by Shin Ingen for a race track application in Opensim in
2014. He decided not to continue development and published the assets as open
source, which is where this project picked it up. Much of the underlying code
has changed since then but the overall framework is based on the original work.
The project also redistributes by permission some of the original assets for the
iTec race car effects.

For the last few years I have been the custodian of a large collection (~70)
scripted land vehicles in Second Life, of all shapes and sizes. This collection
was built by past and prersent members of Burn2, the official Burning Man
regional event in Second Life. I manage the scripting for the collection and
provide scripting kits and workshops for people building new cars. During Burn2
art festival events, server lag is always a concern, and the use of a common
script for vehicles helps avoid lag-producing scripts or unwieldy vehicles.

When I first became involved in the DMV, vehicles in the collection had scripts
from varying sources and of fair quality, some laggy, some poorly written. Many
didn't have desired features. We wanted one vehicle script that could merge the
best features of all of the scripts, fix the bugs, and be low lag as possible
for the server. We also wanted a way to install future script updates with
minimal hassle, ideally without having to hand-transfer settings between
scripts.

Around the same time, Burn2 was developing a stand-alone demo of Burn2's art,
avatars and art cars to be presented at the Burning Man event using an Opensim
installation. The project required importing all the vehicles out of SL and into
the Opensim demo. Our car scripts from SL didn't work in Opensim, so we needed a
script that worked there, ideally one that would work in both grids.

I also began running my own Opensim region which allowed me to test scripts as
they were being developed and make sure they remain compatimble with Opensim,
particularly on obODE and Bullet physics engines.

While we were exploring vehicle script options for Burn2's Opensim demo project,
we discovered the excellent iTec Supercar car script by Shin Ingen. This had the
most interesting and complete set of features, and it was adaptable for the art
cars. We created a pared-down version for the Burning Man Demo with a few
features added to support our cars. Afterwards, I got permission from Shin Ingen
to fork the project since he was not planning to develop it further. I created a
Github page to manage the project and the Supercar Plus project was born. The
project has been running since 2014, and Burn2's DMV in SL officially switched
to the Supercar Plus script in 2015.

One of the goals for the script was to be able to put all car customizations
into the configuration section and have a common, unaltered main script in all
the cars. This allowed us to update vehicles with the new script (with bug fixes
for example) and only need to transfer the config settings to the new script.
Although this did require hand-editing, a single block of text in the
configuration sections could be copied and pasted between the old and new
scripts, requiring only the copy-paste keys. So the task of re-scripting 70
vehicles was not as bad as it might have been, but still not ideal.

In 2017 I added a feature to put all configuration settings in a notecard. The
script, when reset, checks to see if the Config notecard is present, and if so
it will use configs in the notecard  and ignore settings within the script file
itself. This way, script version updates can simply be dropped into the car,
replacing the previous version, without having to hand-edit any settings.

I continually try to find ways to simplify the script, to keep it compatible
across grids, and to add new features wanted by car builders. This is a work in
progress. Please notify me of bugs or feature requests.
