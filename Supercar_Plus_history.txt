Supercar Plus - History

At Burn2, the official Burning Man regional event in Second Life, I am the
custodian of a collection of over 70 scripted art cars of all shapes and sizes.
When I began this job, scripts in these vehicles were of varying quality, some
were laggy, poorly written or didn't have desired features. We wanted one
vehicle script that could merge the best features of all of them, fix the bugs,
and be low lag. We also needed a way to upgrade the script across 70+ cars with
minimal hassle.

In 2015 we showcased some of the Burn2 builds and vehicles in Opensim, and found
that our Second Life vehicle scripts didn't all work in the Opensim environment.
I took on the job of re-scripting the vehicles using an Opensim-compatible
alternative.

During some research I discovered the excellent iTec Supercar and script from
Shin Ingen at Ingen Labs, designed for Opensim. This was the most feature-rich
car script I found, but it had not been maintained or developed since 2014. It
was designed for a race car application. I decided to fork this project and add
my own enhancements, and the Supercar Plus script was born.

First, I made the script work in both SL and Opensim, and made it configurable
for vehicles slow and fast. I added a bunch of features that were needed for
various types of vehicles, merging good features of other scripts. I added a
config section that made it easier for non-programmers to set up. I re-wrote
much of the underlying code to eliminate llListen() and to reduce sim lag.

The resulting script was applied to all our art cars at Burn2, using a common
script and different configuration options. This has reduced sim lag, improves
features and texture of vehicles, and provides an easy upgrade path for newer
versions of the script.

In 2017 I added a feature to put all configuration settings in a notecard. If
the notecard is present in the same object as the script, the script will read
the settings from the notecard only, and ignore settings within the script
itself. This way, script updates can simply be dropped into the car, replacing
the previous version, without having to edit any settings.

This is a work in progress. Please notify me of bugs or feature requests.
