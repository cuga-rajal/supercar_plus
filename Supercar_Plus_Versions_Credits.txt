History and Credits -- Supercar Plus

The iTec Supercar vehicle script was originally developed by Ingen Labs (Shin Ingen @ http://ingen-lab.com:8002)
as a race car script with 12 gears and many great sound and particle effects.
In 2016 Shin Ingen gave me permission to fork the project and post it as open source.
This major re-write improves on the iTec Supercar as noted below.

Version History

Rev 1.1 2015-04-14 Vegaslon  changed llSetVehicleRotationParam to reset all axes <0,0,0>
 Ferd commented out useless code that assigned a var to itself and other vars that are never used.

-  New wheel scripts rotate wheel prims at correct rotation for diameter and speed
- Reverse speed is now same as forward speed
- Removed code that was disabled from previous developers 
- Set to 4 slower speeds for smaller sim
- Added message to driver on sit

Rev 1.3-Cuga 2016-Jan-10
- Updated to work in SL, for use in Burn2
- Auto-detect sit animation in contents; Animation name not needed in configs
- Improved front wheel rotation to prevent wobble

Rev 1.4-Cuga 2016-Mar-04
- Restored racecar speeds, sounds, gear names, burnout & pipeflame effects
Rev 1.5-Cuga 2016-Apr-09
- Many new user config options, including configurable gearing, effects, hover text and more
- Major rewrite of internal messaging, reduced link messages and lag considerably. Eliminated message flooding.
- Restores original prim physics types to child prims on stand;
- Added support for headlights and headlight beams
- Check if sounds are in Contents on rez, to prevent SL script errors if missing
- Added option to turn in place while stopped, like the Mario script
- Added an optional HUD with controls for horn, lights, pipeflame and smokescreen
  (HUD uses llListen() between specific UUIDs)
Rev 1.6
- Faster initialization by SL/OS switch in user config settings
Rev 1.62
- Fix gSitTarget_Rot, add config for SL sounds
Rev 1.63
- Improved engine sounds while driving at low speeds
Rev 1.64
- Fixed startup sound only play on driver sit; Pie menu changes to Sit for passengers after driver is on
Rev 1.65
- Bug fixes and adds the option to use a config file named "Config" to store user settings. If used, the config file settings override main script settings.
Rev 1.66
- Fixes script reset bug introduced in 1.65
Rev 1.67 2017-Mar-11
- New config option to skip reset on rez if using a rezzer and auto-return not needed
Rev 1.68 2017-May-1
- Set Physics TRUE after changing child prims to type None
Rev 1.69 2017-Aug-1
- Dataserver asyncronous, wait till done before initializing engine; Added use_alt_sound.
Rev 1.70 2018-09-28
- Added options for permission to drive the vehicle; Option for anyone in group object belongs to; List of UUIDs allowed to drive
- Added camera controls. CamDist is the camera distance behind the driver. CamPitch is the angle looking down.
  Note: Option-arrow keys can be used to manually override camera view. Hit <esc> to return to camera settings.
- Script no longer resets automatically on changed inventory. Make sure you reset the script manually when needed!
- Script now uses same NC reading functions in Opensim and SL. Single code for both grids. Better OS compatibility.
  Note: this change may break the reading of the Config notecard on older versions of Opensim
- Added option to selectively keep a child prim physics type Prim when driving car, by setting prim description to "prim"
  This can be used to create articulating connections, such as for multi-axle vehicles (experimental)
  Default is to make all child prims physics type None while driving
- Bug fix: Repeated chat messages when changing gears if already to lowest/highest gear
Rev 1.71 2018-09-29
- Some improvements to camera controls
Rev. 1.72 2018-10-24
- Bug fix to support long UUID list
Rev. 1.73 2018-11-04
- llMessageLinked() messages sent to all prims not just child prims. Allows new Trak script to be in root prim.
Rev. 1.74
- llMessageLinked() message "car_park" sent when auto-park activated, allowing removal of rez-on-park objects
Rev. 1.75
- Renamed gears 1-12 (previous names were legacy from original iTec Supercar)
- Gear fallback sends local chat message to driver
- Script reset messages include when loading sounds
- Script resets when updating the Config NC
- Stops default AO sit animation when driving
- Supercar Plus Front Wheel 1.62 released. Improved cylinder prim orientation detecting, improved mesh prim documentation.
  Now one script for both front wheels.
Rev. 1.80
- This is a major rewrite that fixes bugs, improves efficiency and adds features. Better and simpler instructions.
- All assets unique to race cars have been moved to a subfolder, to simplify folder structure.
- The Config section and Config notecard have changed, removing old configs and adding new ones.
  If you are upgrading from a previous version, use the new Config notecard and transfer your settings.
- Many of the add-on scripts have changed to support the new main script. If you are upgrading you may need to update those as well.
- Add-on scripts were previously each on their own version numbers, which created confusion on what is the latest.
  Starting with v1.80, all add-on scripts that depend on this release have also been numbered 1.80
- New headlight script turns on headlights on driver sit, turns off on stand, and supports switching the lights from a HUD
- New horn script merges previous touch and HUD versions, touch horn prim or use HUD to honk
- All car sounds are now configurable in the Config notecard. Comments in the NC provide setup details.
- Script previously set slow or fast engine sound based on detected speed. It now sets this based on gear selected.
  New config "aggressive_gear" sets gear above which plays aggressive sound.
- New config anim_fwd and anim_idle optionally allow different driver animations while stopped or moving forward.
- Some settings have merged and the name kept the same name, but may require changes. See the Config notecard for details.
  For example, "turn_in_place_speed" and "auto_return_time" must now be set to 0 to disable. "hud_name" must be blank to disable.
- Racecar burnout and exhaust scripts have code cleanup but are functionally same as before.
- Wheel scripts have improved support for cylinder prim wheels, and improved instructions for configuring mesh wheels
- New awesome HUD for race car applications
Rev. 1.81
- Added a config "anim_fast", if used, will play this animation instead of anim_fwd when gear is at or above aggressive_gear
- A vehicle physics parameter was changed (VEHICLE_ANGULAR_FRICTION_TIMESCALE) to keep car more level with ground 
- If auto_return_time is not set to 0, rezzing a car in world will reset park location and angle to its rezzed position
- All add-on scripts version 1.80 will work with this update
Rev. 1.82
- Bug fix: Driver camera controls now remain unchanged when passengers jump off. (Thank you Xiija)
Rev. 1.83
- Improved camera controls for passengers, and to match same as driver. Fixed a bug that prevented the stand_message from reaching the driver that stood up. Removed unused variables to reduce memory usage.
Rev. 1.84
- Changed auto-park behavior and fixed 2 bugs related to auto-park.
  When driver stands and auto_return_time is not 0, a message is now broadcast with llSay() so that everyone nearby - including passengers - know that auto-park will occur.
  As a result, stand_message no longer needs to include a notification about auto-park.
  Previously, auto-park would not occur with passengers still seated, and Physics would not be turned off.
  Removed unused variables to reduce memory usage.
Rev. 1.85
- Fixed a bug that caused multiple copies of the HUD to be given to the driver each time a passenger sat on the vehicle, when the HUD was used.
Rev. 1.86
- Added two features to guard against potential issues while vehicle building. If a prim is added or removed from the vehicle, the script now resets automatically. This preserves the correct physics types when driven. If somebody tries to drive the car while the script is still initializing, they are now unseated until initialization is finished.
Rev. 1.87
- Adds a new config option "click_to_park". This option, if enabled, will allow the driver to touch the vehicle to set it to Park mode where the driver can remain seated with the engine and lights off. Click again to re-enable. Useful for such things as drive-in movies.
Rev. 1.88
- Adds a new config option "useAvsitter". If set to TRUE the vehicle script can co-exist with an avSitter scripting system. 
- If set to TRUE, all sit offsets and animation settings in the car script configs are ignored and controlled by avSitter.
- Please note that the driver will remain the same person regardless of their sit position using Swap in avSitter.
Rev. 1.89
- The click_to_park option now restores child prim physics types while parked. Child prims are switched back to physics type None when resuming driving.
- Camera controls for avatars seated as passengers have been removed after feedback from end users.
- If your vehicle used previous versions and you wish to remove the camera eye offset on child prims,
  you will need to use a scrubbing script that sets llSetLinkCamera(LINK\_ALL\_CHILDREN, ZERO\_VECTOR, ZERO\_VECTOR);
Rev. 1.90
- bug fixes related to playing vehicle sounds.
  Vehicles with a sound for driving forward, but no idle sound, such as for snow sleds, now work correctly.
Rev. 1.91
- bug fixes related to playing vehicle sounds.
  Engine startup sound no longer plays each time a passenger sits

rev 2.0 RC9  22-Apr-2023

Rev. 2.0.2
- New feature: Supports wheel option for reverse-direction left-right
- Bug fix: Restored original speed of 1st gear from earlier version.
