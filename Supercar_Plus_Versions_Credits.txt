History and Credits -- Supercar Plus

The Supercar was originally developed by Ingen Labs (Shin Ingen @ http://ingen-lab.com:8002)
as a race car script with 12 gears and many great sound and particle effects.
This major re-write improves on the 2015 Supercar as noted below.

Version History

Rev 1.1 2015-04-14 Vegaslon  changed llSetVehicleRotationParam to reset all axes <0,0,0>
 Ferd commented out useless code that assigned a var to itself and other vars that are never used.

- Rev 1.2VRCamp 2015-06-15 Cuga Rajal  <cugarajal@gmail.com>
- Changed all occurrences of llSay to llRegionSayTo
- Removed all occurrences of listen() and llListen()
- Removed touch menu
- Added compatibility with new wheel rotation script
-  New wheel scripts rotate wheel prims at correct rotation for diameter and speed
- Reverse speed is now same as forward speed
- Removed code that was disabled from previous developers 
- Set to 4 slower speeds for smaller sim
- Added message to driver on sit

Rev 1.3-Cuga 2016-Jan-10
- Updated to work in SL, for use in Burn2
- Auto-detect sit animation in contents; Animation name not needed in configs
- Improved front wheel rotation to prevent wobble
- Reduced number of llMessageLinked messages
Rev 1.4-Cuga 2016-Mar-04
- Restored racecar speeds, sounds, gear names, burnout & pipeflame effects
Rev 1.5-Cuga 2016-Apr-09
- Many new user config options, including configurable gearing, effects, hover text and more
- Major rewrite of internal messaging, reduced link messages and lag considerably. Eliminated message flooding.
- Restores original prim physics types to child prims on stand;
- Added support for headlights and headlight beams
- Check if sounds are in Contents on rez, to prevent SL script errors if missing
- Added option to turn in place while stopped, like the Mario script
- Added an optional HUD with controls for horn, lights, pipeflame and smokescreen
  (HUD uses llListen() between specific UUIDs)
Rev 1.6
- Faster initialization by SL/OS switch in user config settings
Rev 1.62
- Fix gSitTarget_Rot, add config for SL sounds
Rev 1.63
- Improved engine sounds while driving at low speeds
Rev 1.64
- Fixed startup sound only play on driver sit; Pie menu changes to Sit for passengers after driver is on
Rev 1.65
- Bug fixes and adds the option to use a config file named "Config" to store user settings. If used, the config file settings override main script settings.
Rev 1.66
- Fixes script reset bug introduced in 1.65
Rev 1.67 2017-Mar-11
- New config option to skip reset on rez if using a rezzer and auto-return not needed
Rev 1.68 2017-May-1
- Set Physics TRUE after changing child prims to type None
Rev 1.69 2017-Aug-1
- Dataserver asyncronous, wait till done before initializing engine; Added use_alt_sound.
Rev 1.70 2018-09-28
- Added options for permission to drive the vehicle; Option for anyone in group object belongs to; List of UUIDs allowed to drive
- Added camera controls. CamDist is the camera distance behind the driver. CamPitch is the angle looking down.
  Note: Option-arrow keys can be used to manually override camera view. Hit <esc> to return to camera settings.
- Script no longer resets automatically on changed inventory. Make sure you reset the script manually when needed!
- Script now uses same NC reading functions in Opensim and SL. Single code for both grids. Better OS compatibility.
  Note: this change may break the reading of the Config notecard on older versions of Opensim
- Added option to selectively keep a child prim physics type Prim when driving car, by setting prim description to "prim"
  This can be used to create articulating connections, such as for multi-axle vehicles (experimental)
  Default is to make all child prims physics type None while driving
- Bug fix: Repeated chat messages when changing gears if already to lowest/highest gear
Rev 1.71 2018-09-29
- Some improvements to camera controls
Rev. 1.72 2018-10-24
- Bug fix to support long UUID list
Rev. 1.73 2018-11-04
- llMessageLinked() messages sent to all prims not just child prims. Allows new Trak script to be in root prim.
Rev. 1.74
- llMessageLinked() message "car_park" sent when auto-park activated, allowing removal of rez-on-park objects
Rev. 1.75
- Renamed gears 1-12 (previous names were from original iTec Supercar)
- Gear fallback sends local chat message to driver
- Reset messages indicate when loading sounds
- Script resets when updating the Config NC
- Stops default AO sit animation when driving
- Supercar Plus Front Wheel 1.62 released. Improved cylinder prim orientation detecting, improved mesh prim documentation.
  Now one script for both front wheels.
